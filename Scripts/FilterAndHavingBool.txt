# An input file for simpleOperators.sh that generates global operators for simple conditions that return Filter and Having clauses.
# This file contains both the operators and the types for conditions with Bool as a type of one of the operands.
# The generated code is in Sources/FilterAndHaving_GlobalFunctions.swift.
